# TriangleClassifier
Triangle Classifier GUI made during my Grade 11 Computer Science course in High School (Spring 2018).

## Run Instructions
Download and extract the [TriangleClassifier.zip](https://github.com/justinbauer-1/TriangleClassifier/blob/master/TriangleClassifier.zip) folder and run the `TriangleClassifier.jar` file to see the program in action (need to have a JDK installed). Alternatively, you can run the TriangleClassifierInterface.java file to start the program by your own means.

## Program Explanation
Simple GUI program to determine type of triangle based on angles. Warning messages occur when angles do not add up to 180 degrees. Settings available to change language between English, French and German. Language settings are saved when the program is closed and remembered when the program reopens.
